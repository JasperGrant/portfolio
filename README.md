#Engineering Portfolio Website

Portfolio to demonstrate my achievements while also providing a demonstration of skills in React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Finished website features a properly linked projects page, an informative landing page and about me page, along with working headers and footers.

The goal is for design to look as professional as possible.
